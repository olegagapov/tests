The code is quite simple here. In the boot method, we put the code to allow the developer
to export the config options by simply writing:

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=package-tests-config

And in the register method, we tell the Laravel app to add the config options from
our file into the web app config. Commit the update and letâ€™s create our config file next.

composer require OlegAgapov/Tests --dev



cd packages/OlegAgapov/Tests/src/config

cd ../../../../../


cd packages/OlegAgapov/Tests

cd ../../../
